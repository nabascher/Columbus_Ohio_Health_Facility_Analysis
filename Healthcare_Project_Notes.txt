---------Log of work for Healthcare Analytics Project-----

01/06/2024:
	- The first page of the report has been finished and published to the Power BI service. 
	First page is a summary of the number of healthcare facilities within Columbus, Ohio communities.
	
	- Today, I downloaded some street centerline data from Columbus, Ohio open data portal. 
	Also performed some summary within analysis for demographic data within the communities. Working 
	with the community data is preferable for analysis over using census tracts.   

01/07/2024:
	- Made some minor updates to the existing page of report such as implementing drilldown. 
	Exported some new tables to add to PowerBI from ArcGIS for demographic analysis.  

02/17/2024:
	- Concluded demographics analysis in Power BI. 
	I scrapped my idea of trying to relate the demographic data with the Communities as the data becomes too diluted.
	Next, I will begin my network Analysis in ArcGIS Pro, which will hopefully yield more meaningful results.
