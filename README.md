This repo contains the files that I will be creating as I conduct my analysis of medical facility distrobution in Columbus, Ohio. 
I'm using this process to explore Power BI and its integration with ArcGIS.

Here's what is found in this repo:

1. Data source list contains the list of datesets and their sources.
2. The ArcGIS and Power BI project files.
3. The raw master geodatabase containing all of the unedited spatial and tabular data.
4. My working geodatabase of edited spatial data.
5. Analysis tables
