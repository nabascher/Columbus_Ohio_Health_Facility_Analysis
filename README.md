This repo contains the files that I will be creating as I conduct my analysis of medical facility distribution in Columbus, Ohio. 

I'm using this process to explore Power BI and its integration with ArcGIS.

My analysis explores the accessibility of medical facilities within different geofences in Columbus, Ohio. I am also integrating US Census demographic data with a network analysis in ArcGIS Pro to explore possible relationships between travel time to medical facilities for different racial groups.
